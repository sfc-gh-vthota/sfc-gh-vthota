They collect customer reviews to get customer feedback on their food-trucks which come in from multiple sources and span multiple languages. This enables them to better understand the areas which require improvement and drive up customer loyalty along with satisfaction. \n\nIn this notebook, we will look at how we analyze these collated customer reviews using Snowflake Cortex to understand :\n  * How likely their customers are to recommend Tasty Bytes food trucks to someone they know \n  * How good their overall experience was\n  * How is the customer sentiment across customer base\n  * What customers are feel saying about different aspects like food, price etc\n  * What are the main issues and how to remedy them"
